# WoW Raid Helper Discord Bot

WoW Raid Helper Discord Bot is designed to help raid leaders create and manage signups for upcoming raids. It ensures that raid times are displayed in each user's local timezone, eliminating the need for manual time conversions and makes tracking of signups easier.

## Features

- **Easy Raid Signups**: Create raid events where users can sign up quickly.
- **Automated Timezone Conversion**: Displays raid start times based on each user's timezone.
- **Raid Tracking**: Keeps track of when the raid starts and who has signed up.
- **User-Friendly Commands**: Simple and intuitive bot commands for raid leaders and participants.

## Inspiration

This bot was inspired by a friend who runs regular raids and needed an easier way to manage signups and timezones for players across different regions.
